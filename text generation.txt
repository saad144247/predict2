The Pakistani rupee (Urdu: روپیہ; ISO code: PKR; symbol: 𞱱; abbreviation:
 Re (singular) and Rs (plural)) is the official currency of the Islamic Republic
 of Pakistan. It is divided into one hundred paise (Urdu: پیسہ); however, paisa-
denominated coins have not been legal tender since 2013. The issuance of the currency 
is controlled by the State Bank of Pakistan. It was officially adopted by the Government of Pakistan in 1949. Earlier 
the coins and notes were issued and controlled by the Reserve Bank of India until 1949, when it was handed over 
to the Government and State Bank of Pakistan, by the Government and Reserve Bank of India.

In Pakistani English, large values of rupees are counted in thousands; lac (hundred thousands); crore (ten-m
illions); arab (billion); kharab (hundred billion). Numbers are still grouped in thousands

Main article: History of the rupee
The word rūpiya is derived from the Sanskrit word rūpya, which means "wrought silver, a coin of silver",[2] 
in origin an adjective meaning "shapely", with a more specific meaning of "stamped, impressed", whence "coin". It is derived 
from the noun rūpa "shape, likeness, image". Rūpaya was used to denote the coin introduced by Sher Shah Suri during his reign from 1540 to 1545 CE.


The Pakistan (Monetary System and Reserve Bank) Order, 1947 was issued on 14 August 1947, by the Governor 

General of pre-partition British India, following the advice of an expert committee. It designated the Reserve Bank of India (
RBI) as the temporary monetary authority for both India and Pakistan until 30 September 1948. During this transitional period,
 currency notes issued by the RBI and the Government of India were to remain legal tender in Pakistan. The order also allowed these notes to bear inscriptions 
of Government of Pakistan in Urdu and English, to be circulated from 1 April 1948.[3] Like the Indian rupee, it was originally divided into 16 annas, each of 4 pice or 12 pie.

For the first seven months following partition, currency issued by the RBI and the Government of India continued to circulate in Pakistan. Modified 
RBI notes in denominations of 2, 5, 10, and 100 rupees, and 1-rupee notes from the Government of India were later introduced. The modifications involved inscribing Government of 
Pakistan in English and "Hakumat-e-Pakistan" in Urdu on the front of the notes.[3]

An early 1948 agreement between the governments of India and Pakistan resulted in an amendment to the Pakistan (Monetary System and Reserve Bank) Order, 1947, moving up the d
eadline for the RBI's role as Pakistan's monetary authority from 30 September 1948, to 30 June 1948. Concurrently, the arrangement for the RBI to supply inscribed Indian note
s to Pakistan was terminated on 30 June 1948.[3]


In January 1961, the currency was decimalised, with the rupee subdivided into 100 pice, renamed (in English) paise (singular paisa) later th
e same year. However, coins denominated in paise have not been issued since 1996.

In 1972, the newly independent Bangladesh introduced the taka originally at parity with the Pakistani rupee. Afterwards, the Pakistani
 rupee ceased to be legal tender in Bangladesh.

Paisa-denominated coins ceased to be legal tender in 2013, leaving the Re. 1/- coin as the minimum legal tende
r.[1] On 15 October 2015, the Pakistan government introduced a revised Rs. 5/- coin with a reduced size and weight
